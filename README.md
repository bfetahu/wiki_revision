# Wikipedia Revision Analysis

This application compares two consecutive Wikipedia article revisions, and checks what statements have been added, deleted or updated.

For each statement, we have three labels:
* **2** if the statement has been added
* **-1** if the statement has been deleted
* **1** if the statement is updated.
